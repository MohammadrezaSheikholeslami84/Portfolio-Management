# Portfolio Management

## Description
The **Portfolio Management** project is designed to help individuals and institutions effectively manage their investment portfolios. It allows users to track and analyze their assets, evaluate portfolio performance, and make data-driven decisions for financial growth. 

This system is built with a focus on **data analysis**, **risk management**, and **visualization**, enabling users to understand how their investments are performing and assess the potential risks associated with different assets in their portfolio. The project is implemented using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy to provide a rich set of tools for analysis.

Key features include:
- **Portfolio Evaluation:** Calculates and visualizes key performance metrics such as returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and more.
- **Real-time Data Integration:** Integrates real-time stock market and financial data for up-to-date portfolio tracking.
- **Risk Analysis:** Provides tools for assessing portfolio risk through Value-at-Risk (VaR) and other advanced risk measures.
- **Asset Allocation:** Helps users allocate their investments efficiently based on their risk preferences and financial goals.
- **Visualization Tools:** Uses advanced charts and graphs to visualize portfolio performance and asset distribution over time.

## Features
- Track investments in **stocks**, **bonds**, and **alternative assets** (cryptocurrency, real estate, etc.).
- **Portfolio Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance using metrics like returns, risk-adjusted returns, volatility, etc.
- **Risk Assessment**: Includes tools to assess and minimize portfolio risk, such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Monte Carlo simulations.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Analyze past performance of assets and simulate future scenarios using historical data.
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts for portfolio allocation, performance trends, and risk distribution.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
